## Application Overview

The GUI provides a simple, user-friendly interface for running DICOM processing pipelines without needing to use command-line tools.

### Main Features
- ‚úÖ **Two Processing Modes**: Single location or multiple locations (batch)
- ‚úÖ **Memory System**: Remembers your last 3 inputs for each field
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Progress**: See processing progress and logs in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Virtual Environment Integration**: Automatically uses the project's virtual environment
- ‚úÖ **Log Management**: View, clear, and save processing logs

---

## Tab 1: Single Location Processing

Use this tab to process DICOM files from **one data location**.

### Configuration Steps

1. **DICOM Data Location**
   - Click "Browse" to select your DICOM data folder
   - Or type the path directly
   - The dropdown shows your 3 most recent locations

2. **Project Name** (Optional)
   - Enter a custom name for your project
   - If left empty, the app auto-generates a name from folder structure
   - The dropdown shows your 3 most recent project names

3. **Pipeline Stages**
   - ‚úÖ **Required stages** (S1, S2, S3): Always needed
   - ‚öôÔ∏è **Optional stages**: Check only what you need
     - **S0 ZIP**: Extract ZIP files first
     - **S0 ISO**: Extract ISO files first  
     - **S4**: Create ZIP archives for storage
     - **S5**: AI-powered document extraction

4. **Advanced Settings**
   - **Min files per study**: Minimum files required (default: 10)
   - **Max workers**: Number of parallel processes (default: 4)

### Action Buttons
- **Start Processing**: Begin the full pipeline
- **Setup Only**: Just setup the virtual environment
- **Show Config**: Display current configuration

---

## Tab 2: Multi-Location (Batch) Processing

Use this tab to process **multiple DICOM locations** with the same settings.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Add Data Locations**
   - Enter or browse for each DICOM data location
   - Click "Add" to add it to the list
   - Use "Remove Selected" or "Clear All" to manage the list
   - The dropdown remembers your recent locations

2. **Batch Settings**
   - **Project Naming**: 
     - **Auto**: Uses folder names (recommended)
     - **Custom**: You provide a base name (gets numbered: name_001, name_002...)
   - **Max Workers**: Parallel processes for batch (default: 4)
   - **Min Files per Study**: Same as single location (default: 10)

### Action Buttons
- **Start Batch Processing**: Process all locations sequentially
- **Resume Processing**: Continue interrupted batch processing
- **Show Batch Config**: Display current batch configuration

---

## Processing Output & Logs

### Real-time Display
- All processing output appears in the bottom section
- Shows commands being run, progress, and any errors
- Auto-scrolls to show latest output

### Control Buttons
- **Stop Process**: Immediately stop the current processing
- **Clear Output**: Clear the log display
- **Save Log**: Save the current log to a file

---

## Memory System

The application remembers your **3 most recent inputs** for each field:

### What's Remembered
- ‚úÖ DICOM data locations (single mode)
- ‚úÖ Project names (single mode)  
- ‚úÖ Multi-location paths (batch mode)

### How It Works
- Input history saved automatically in `gui_memory.pkl`
- Dropdown lists show recent entries
- Most recent entries appear first
- Memory persists between sessions

## Tips for Non-Technical Users

### Getting Started
1. **Start with Single Location** if you're new to the tool
2. **Use Browse buttons** instead of typing paths manually
3. **Keep default settings** for most cases
4. **Check the logs** if something goes wrong

### Common Workflows

**Basic DICOM Processing:**
1. Select your DICOM folder
2. Keep S1, S2, S3 checked (required stages)
3. Click "Start Processing"
4. Wait and watch the progress logs

**Processing ZIP Files:**
1. Check "S0 ZIP - ZIP File Extraction" 
2. Select the folder containing ZIP files
3. The tool will extract ZIPs first, then process DICOM files

**Batch Processing Multiple Hospitals:**
1. Go to "Multi Location (Batch)" tab
2. Add each hospital's data folder
3. Click "Start Batch Processing"
4. Each location processes completely before moving to the next

### Troubleshooting

**"Process is already running"**
- Wait for current process to finish, or click "Stop Process"

**"Data location does not exist"**
- Double-check your folder path
- Make sure the folder contains DICOM files

**Application won't start:**
- Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed
- Run `start_gui.bat` (Windows) or `python launch_gui.py`

**Virtual environment issues:**
- Click "Setup Only" to reinstall dependencies
- Check that `venv` folder exists in the project directory
